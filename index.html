                Happy anniversary, my love! You're my forever.
                To my heart, my soul, my everything. Cheers to us and many more years together My lovely Hashi. It's easy to fall in love, but staying in love with the same person for the rest of one's life is considerably more difficult. May God provide us the strength to stay for ever my dear wife(Hashi) 😘😙
                Not everyone has been able to find true love that thrives and grows over time. Finding you, my love, has been a true blessing. May our relationship be blessed with many more years of growth and blessings💝🎀🫀.
